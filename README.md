# 🍔 Eatzy App

<br>

**Eatzy** is a simple app that shows a list of the **10 nearest restaurants** based on the **postcode** you select. I built it using the **SwiftUI** framework to create a **clean** and **responsive interface**. The app also includes a **Lottie animation** to make the UI more engaging, and I used **Swift Testing** to make sure the core features work smoothly.

## Features  

- **Light/dark** mode toggle  
- **Responsive** app design  
- **Swift Testing** to ensure the logic works as expected  
- **Lottie Animation** to add movement and personality to the UI  
- **Network management** to fetch and display restaurants based on postcode  
- **Architecture**: separation of concerns using View and ViewModel  

<br>

## Implementations   

- I decided to create a **SwiftUI app** that displays the **10 nearest restaurants** based on user input.  
- Instead of hardcoding a specific postcode, I added a **text field with a button**, allowing users to **enter any postcode** they like.  
- The restaurant list includes a **carousel at the top** showcasing the **3 best-rated restaurants**, which was not required by the brief, but I thought it would be a nice touch to enhance the experience.  
- The interface is clean, responsive, and designed with a focus on usability and clarity.

<br>

## Improvements   

- Implement the **location button**, currently shown in the text field, to allow users to fetch restaurants based on their **current location**.  
- Improve **accessibility** by supporting:
  - **VoiceOver**  
  - **Dynamic Type**  
  - **Haptic feedback**  
  - **High-contrast colour schemes**
